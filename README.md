## Scene Name: Driving

### Scene Assets
- Terrain Environment
- Concrete Road
- Animal Crossing Sign
- Cougars
- Car

### Scene Description
In this scene, the user will start inside a car. Starting the car initiates a series of tutorials that guide the user on accelerating, steering, braking, and responding to animal crossing signs. After completing the tutorials, the user can freely explore the scene.

The scene features various cougars, some walking on the road and others crossing it. If the user collides with a cougar or a roadside rock, the car's windshield will shatter.

### Project Controls (Both Hands Should be on the Steering Wheel)

1. **Right Vive Trigger Button:** Accelerates the car. Releasing the button slows down the car.

2. **Left Vive Touchpad:** Controls car steering, allowing you to change its direction.

3. **Right Vive Touchpad:** Similar to the left touchpad, it controls car steering for directional changes.

4. **Left Trigger Button:** Applies the car's brakes.

5. **Right Grip Button:** Repositions the car to its initial starting point.

### Conclusion
We have successfully met all the project requirements outlined in the preliminary prototype document, the final prototype document, and even achieved the stretch goals set for the project.

Please Note: We have made significant improvements to the project since the preliminary stage, addressing all the professor's demands for both the preliminary and final prototypes.
